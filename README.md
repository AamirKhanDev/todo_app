Hello and welcome to my fullstack project using MongoDb, Express.js, React, Node.js [MERN]

To access this project please follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository onto your machine
2. Open 2 terminals within your IDE. Ensure 1 terminal is in the root directory `\todo_app` and execute the commands `npm install` and `npm run backend`. This will run our database that we have implemented.
3. In your 2nd terminal navigate to `\todo_app\client` and execute the command `npm install` and `npm start`. This will run our frontend server and allow React to render everything we need.
4. Enjoy
